/* Private keys are what are used to unlock satoshis
from a particular address. In Bitcoin, a private key 
in standard format is simply a 256-bit number, between the values:
0x01 and 
0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140,
representing nearly the entire range of 2256-1 values. The range is governed by the
secp256k1 ECDSA encryption standard used by Bitcoin */
